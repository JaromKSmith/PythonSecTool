
**Integrated Ethical Cybersecurity Tool Suite**

Description: In this assignment, students will demonstrate their proficiency in cybersecurity scripting by creating four distinct security or automation tools using Python. These tools should address various aspects of cybersecurity, administrative functions, or devops, such as network scanning, encryption, intrusion detection, and more. The final deliverable will be an integrated program that orchestrates these tools, executing them as individual modules upon command.

The tools you develop will be left up to you.  While you can reuse an idea of a tool we have created in this course, you cannot simply reuse the tool directly; it needs to introduce a new aspect or expanded functionality in order to be accepted.  Additionally, no more that two course tools can be included in the final project.  

As part of the class presentation, you will need to explain your tools, why you chose them, demonstrate working tools, and be able to answer any questions.  

Be sure to adhere to all legal and ethical practices when building and testing these tools.  

**Objective:**

Develop four separate, functional cybersecurity or automation tools using Python.
Integrate these tools into a cohesive program that orchestrates their execution.
Implement best programming practices including PEP8 formatting, secure secrets storage, abstraction, and other relevant conventions.
Prepare and present a comprehensive demonstration of the integrated tool suite to the class.




**Assignment Requirements:**

**Development of Four Distinct Tools:**

- Each tool should serve a unique cybersecurity or automation purpose.
- These tools should not be direct copies of previous course projects. If reusing previous tools, they must be significantly enhanced or expanded with new features. (No more than 2 reused tools from the course)

**Integration into a Unified Program:**

- Create a master script that can call and execute each tool as separate modules.
- Ensure the tools can run independently and return results or perform actions based on user input.

**Programming Practices:**

- Adhere to PEP8 formatting guidelines.
- Implement secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys.
- Apply abstraction and modularization where applicable for code maintainability.

**Documentation and Demonstration:**

- Prepare detailed documentation explaining the functionality of each tool and the integrated program.
- Present a short recorded demonstration of your project running live and working, explaining the code, showcasing tool functionality, and providing a walkthrough for each tool. (5 - 10 minutes)

**Grading Rubric:**

**Functionality of Tools (30%)**

- Completeness of each tool's functionality.
- Integration and seamless execution within the master program.

**Code Quality and Best Practices (20%)**

- Adherence to PEP8 standards.
- Secure handling of sensitive information.
- Effective use of abstraction and modular programming.

**Innovation and Improvement (20%)**

- Uniqueness or significant enhancement of reutilized tools.
- Addition of new features or functionalities.

**Video Documentation and Presentation (30%)**

- Clarity and completeness of documentation.
- Coherence and effectiveness of the recorded demonstration.

If you need some ideas on what to develop, here are some possible options:

**Vulnerability Scanner:**

Create a Python script that scans a given network for active devices and ports
Implement features to identify service banners and potential vulnerabilities.
Integrate with APIs to retrieve and present related CVEs.

**Password Strength Checker:**

Develop a program that assesses the strength of passwords based on criteria like length, complexity, and commonality.
Incorporate password hashing and provide recommendations for stronger passwords.

**Log File Analyzer:**

Build a script that analyzes log files from various sources (e.g., web server logs, system logs) for suspicious activities.
Implement algorithms to detect potential security incidents or anomalies.

**Web Application Vulnerability Scanner:**

Create a tool that scans web applications for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).
Include a reporting feature that outlines discovered vulnerabilities and suggests remediation steps.

**File Encryption and Decryption Tool:**

Design a Python program that encrypts and decrypts files using strong cryptographic algorithms.
Include features like key management and secure file sharing.

**Brute Force Attack Detector:**

Develop a script that monitors login attempts and detects potential brute force attacks on a system.
Implement rate limiting and alert mechanisms for suspicious activities.

**Firewall Rule Manager:**

Create a tool that manages firewall rules on a system.
Allow users to define and modify rules, with a focus on security best practices.

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**

Build a basic IDS that monitors network traffic or system activity for patterns indicative of an attack.
Provide alerts for potential security incidents and log relevant information.

**Secure File Transfer Protocol:**

Develop a secure file transfer application using Python.
Ensure encryption, authentication, and integrity checks for files transferred between systems.
Provide options to send the files securely to remote clients

**Security Awareness Training Game:**

Create an interactive and educational game that teaches users about cybersecurity best practices.
Include scenarios such as phishing simulations, password hygiene challenges, and identifying security threats.

**Management Dashboard:**

Create an IT, devops, or security management dashboard that displays system(s) information.
Consolidate data and display output and analytics

**Security Newsfeed:**

Create an automated newsfeed aggregator to retrieve security alerts and news.
Provide alerts to the user and present updates in a user-friendly format.
